      "Developed a predictive stock price forecasting system using deep learning techniques. Implemented an LSTM-based neural network with TensorFlow and Keras to analyze historical stock data and predict future trends. Integrated sentiment analysis from financial news to improve model accuracy. Evaluated model performance using MSE and RMSE metrics, with hyperparameter optimization using Grid Search. The application was deployed with Streamlit for real-time stock analysis.",

Implemented an SVM-based classification model with Scikit-learn to accurately differentiate between spam and legitimate emails. Extracted key email features using natural language processing (NLP) and TF-IDF vectorization. Evaluated model accuracy using precision, recall, and F1-score metrics. Built a Streamlit-based UI for interactive testing, allowing users to input email text and receive real-time spam classification.",
